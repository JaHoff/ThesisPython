# ThesisPython
Python components of my thesis, main usable body of work is centralized in the core container function files (main folder), and the files created for the preparation of the final presentation. 

Sub-folders contain specialised files for the application of the functions and code contained in the core files, these are not documented in detail and are primarily included to show how these functions can be used to analyse data.

Code was developed primarily for personal use and thus documentation may be lacking, feel free to approach me for any questions regarding gaps in documentation.
